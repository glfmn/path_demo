# Pathfinding in Video Games

A demonstration of path finding in video games.  The presentation is in the form of a long code example written in Rust and `tcod`.   Once you have seen the presentation, you can look into the source code to learn more about some cool pathfinding algorithms!

# Building the Presentation

The presentation can be run with the rust toolchain using

```
cargo run --release
```

Running without optimizations can be prohibitively slow.
